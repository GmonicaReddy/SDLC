# Synthetic E-commerce Data Project

This repository contains code and data generation scripts for creating synthetic e-commerce datasets (around 5 files) 

The data will be ingested into an SQLite database, followed by SQL queries to join multiple tables and generate reports.

Developed using Cursor AI-assisted development tool as part of the A-SDLC exercise.
